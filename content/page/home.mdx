      ## Cancer isn’t one disease.


      It’s incredibly complex and dynamic – varying massively across organs,
      subtypes, molecular signature, and groups of people.


      Because this complexity is so hard to  navigate, many people with cancer
      are being failed by today’s medicine.

      Created out of 15 years of world-leading research at the pioneering
      Wellcome Sanger Institute, the single largest contributor to the mapping
      of the human genome.
    body: "Building upon the work of Dr Mathew Garnett, co -discoverer of B-raf and leader of Sanger’s Translational Cancer Genomics Lab, we combine experimental and computational biology to work at an unrivalled scale – which leads to a nuanced understanding of cancer \Land its complexities.\n\nThis approach, coupled with an exceptional knowledge of clinical translation lead by Emile Voest (Sanofi Board, founder of multiple personalised medicine initiatives) and John Tsai (former Novartis CMO) allows us to identify and develop more targeted and more effective combination treatments at speed, creating a much higher probability of clinical success.\n"

        componentText: >
          We study hundreds of diverse cancer models generated from patients’
          biopsy samples. Genome-scale CRISPR screening across \[>1300] of these
          deeply-characterised tumour models allows us to identify the strongest
          biomarkers, and predict responses.


          As the only people in the world who have generated this scale of
          uncontaminated data, as well as the expertise to perturb cancer
          material with such nuance, we have gained an unparalleled
          understanding of tumours, and the effectiveness of potential
          treatments.

          actionable hypotheses that can be tested in the lab, enabling us to
          better stratify patients and improve response rate.


          The more data we generate and hypotheses we test, the better we are at
